"""
Some new cashiers started to work at your restaurant.

They are good at taking orders, but they don't know how to capitalize words, or use a space bar!

All the orders they create look something like this:

"milkshakepizzachickenfriescokeburgerpizzasandwichmilkshakepizza"

The kitchen staff are threatening to quit, because of how difficult it is to read the orders.

Their preference is to get the orders as a nice clean string with spaces and capitals like so:

"Burger Fries Chicken Pizza Pizza Pizza Sandwich Milkshake Milkshake Coke"

The kitchen staff expect the items to be in the same order as they appear in the menu.
